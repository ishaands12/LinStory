# The Building Blocks (Basis)

We can reach any point in 2D space by combining just two vectors—as long as they aren't parallel. These two vectors form a **Basis**.

They are the skeleton of the coordinate system. Changing the coefficients is like giving walking directions: "Go 2 steps along $v_1$, then 1 step along $v_2$".

# Changing the Grid (Change of Basis)

What if we changed the definition of "Right" and "Up"?

If we choose different basis vectors, we create a skewed grid. This is what it means to verify a **Change of Basis**. The point in space stays the same, but its address (coordinates) changes entirely.

# Linear Independence

If your basis vectors line up (parallel), the grid collapses into a line. You can only reach points on that line. This means the vectors are **Linearly Dependent**. A true basis must cover the full dimension.
